	<h2>HTML Fundamentals</h2>
	<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
	<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is interpreted by
		the browser, and it is used to create the structure of web pages. Each
		element you see on a page (each paragraph, header, etc.) is there
		because of HTML (and, yes, the formal name for these components of a
		web page is "element").</p>
	<h3>What is the basic structure of an HTML document?</h3>
	<p>An HTML document has a standard skeleton that consists of
		several opening and closing tags. These tags include:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>A Doctype Declaration: </b>This tells the browser what
			type of document it is interpreting.</li>
		<li><b>A Root Tag: </b>The root tag of any HTML document is the
			"html" tag.</li>
		<li><b>A Head Tag: </b>This tag contains metadata about our
			document. This metadata includes information about the set of
			characters being used and the page's title.</li>
		<li><b>A Body Tag: </b>The body tag contains other tags which
			represent the elements on the page you can see. Here you'll find
			paragraph tags, div tags, etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>How are HTML elements rendered?</h3>
	<p>Remember that HTML is an interpreted language. This means that
		your browser knows how to make sense of HTML -- no compilation needed.
		When your browser is interpreting HTML, it renders each element on the
		page sequentially. And this isn't just true of HTML elements -- it's
		also true of any script or style tags you might be using.</p>
	<h3>What are some common HTML tags?</h3>
	<p>Let's start with a basic paragraph tag. We've been using this
		one all along. We've also been using various header tags, of which
		there are six, each one getting progressively smaller. Check it out:</p>
	<h1 id="theBiggest">I'm the biggest!</h1>
	<h2 id="secondLargest">I'm the second largest.</h2>
	<h3>I'm the third largest, which really means I'm pretty average.</h3>
	<h4>I'm the fourth largest, so you can't see me that well.</h4>
	<h5>I'm even more obnoxiously less large.</h5>
	<h6>I'm so tiny that I sometimes wonder why I even exist.</h6>
	<p>And what's a web page without images? Let's spice this page up
		by adding an image using the "img" tag! By the way, the "img" tag is a
		self-closing tag, which means that we don't have to use a closing tag
		to terminate it.</p>
	<p>Of course, a web page isn't a web page without links. So let's
		make our image a link by wrapping it in an "a" tag.</p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_Assemble_(TV_series)"
		target="\_blank"><img
		src="https://dz2cdn3.dzone.com/storage/article-thumb/10433546-thumb.jpg" /></a>
	<p>We can also add lists to our pages. There are two types of lists
		that we can choose from: ordered and unordered lists. Let's have a
		look now, shall we?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This is an ordered list. Hence the tag name "ol", which
			definitely stands for ordered list.</li>
		<li>I'm item number two in this here ordered list!</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>I'm an unordered list I'm just unorganized and scattered as
			Christina's brain on most days.</li>
		<li>I'm the second list item in this list, but I'm just a bullet
			point because order doesn't matter in an unordered list.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Let's not forget about the "div" tag, which allows us to create
		sections by div-iding the page.</p>
	<div style="background-color: gray; width: 600px; height: 50px;">
		<p>I'm a paragraph within a div. This means that this div is my
			immediate parent.</p>
	</div>
	<p>As of HTML5, we can even use the new and exciting "canvas" tag.
		This allows us to create 2D/3D canvases.</p>
	<canvas id="canvasExample" width="250" height="250"></canvas>
	<!-- In order to interact with this canvas, we'll need some
		good ole JavaScript. In order to do so, we'll have to use
		the "script" tag. -->
	<script>
		var canvas = document.getElementById("canvasExample");
		var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
		context.moveTo(100, 0);
		context.lineTo(400, 400);
		context.stroke();
	</script>
	<p>And this, my friends, is the most magical tag there is: the
		c-section!</p>
	<c-section>This is a Christina section. I just made it up,
	but that's totally valid.</c-section>
	<p>But on a more serious note, there's one more big element you'll
		need to know about: the "form" tag (and all of its sub tags, ofr
		course). We can use it to get user input.</p>
	<form class="form-item">
		<label for="youremail" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"
			class="form-item">Email Address: </label> <input type="email"
			id="youremail"
			style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; border-radius: 5px;"
			class="form-item" /> <label for="yourpassword"
			style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;" class="form-item">Password:
		</label> <input type="password" id="yourpassword"
			style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; border-radius: 5px;"
			class="form-item" />
		<button
			style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; border-radius: 5px;"
			class="form-item">Don't Press Me!</button>
	</form>
	<h2>How do we add some style to our HTML documents?</h2>
	<p>Alright. HTML5 is cool and all, but isn't this page a bit...
		boring? Let's spruce it up a bit.</p>
	<h3>Styling Your Web Page (In 3 Ways)!</h3>
	<p>There are three different ways to style your web pages. You can
		use:</p>
	<ol>
		<!-- These are in order from worst practice to best practice. -->
		<li>Inline CSS</li>
		<li>Style Tags (Internal CSS)</li>
		<li>External Style Sheets</li>
	</ol>
	<p style="font-family: cursive;">
		<b>Inline CSS</b> entails styling your elements right here in the HTML
		file using the "style" attribute (hence the term "inline"). This
		paragraph, for instance, is being styled using inline CSS.
	</p>
	<p id="styledUsingAStyleTag">
		A <b>Style Tag</b> is an HTML tag inside of which we can write a block
		of CSS. So let's style this paragraph using a style tag!
	</p>
	<style>
#styledUsingAStyleTag {
	color: blue;
}
</style>
	<p>
		Our final option for styling a web page is, of course, using an <b>External
			Style Sheet</b>. That said, let's head to the top of our document to load
		up our style sheet!
	</p>
	<h2>What are some of the ways of selecting HTML elements?</h2>
	<p>Knowing how to select elements is important for multiple
		reasons, two of which are the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>You need to select HTML elements in order to apply CSS styles
			to them.</li>
		<li>You need to select HTML elements in order to manipulate your
			web page using JavaScript (we'll talk more about this later).
	</ol>
	<p>Here are just a few of the ways in which we can select HTML
	elements in CSS</p>
	<ul>
		<li>by id</li>
		<li>by class</li>
		<li>by element</li>
		<li>by attribute</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As you've already seen, we can assign an ID, class, or attribute
	to an element of our choosing. Note, however, that you should only
	use a specific ID for one element while classes are traditionally
	used to group many elements together.</p>
	<footer><h2 style="text-align: center">This is a footer.</h2></footer>
